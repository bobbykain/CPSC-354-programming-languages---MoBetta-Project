# CPCS 354 Programming Languages

**MoBetta Final Project**

**Teacher: Dr. Moshier**


A large percentage of this project was provided by [Dr. Moshier](https://mandrewmoshier.github.io/CPSC354/), and we had to work with him and our fellow students to finish implementing the rest of the parser and engine for the MoBetta language.
